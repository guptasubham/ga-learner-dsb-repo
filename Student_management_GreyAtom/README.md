### Project Overview

 This was a project that I have made in order to complete the course on Python on GreyAtom.com, which is a learning website for data-science aspirants. In this project, a replica of the student management system was made. The project included all the functionality that was taught in the course. 


### Learnings from the project

 On completing this project I became comfortable with the different terms and data-types in python, also learned about the methods and other functions. I also learned about the python modules and how to use them in a project.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 A few datasets of students and their marks were provided, 
I firstly merged the datasets and removed all the unwanted data in there. Then for finding the highest marks scored in a course I used basic max functions on the key-value dictionary that was created from the dataset. Next for finding the topper the keys and values of the dictionary were fetched separately, then to determine the topper I tried to find the element from the keys list with the index from the values list that corresponds to the highest-marks scored.
